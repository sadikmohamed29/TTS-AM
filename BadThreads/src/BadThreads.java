//2. It is always guaranteed to do so.

//-  However, this result is not guaranteed, because there is no happens-before relationship between "Key statement 1" and "Key statement 2". This is true even if "Key statement 1" actually executes before "Key statement 2" â€” remember, a happens-before relationship is about visibility, not sequence.

//3. Changing the arguments of the two sleep invocations does not help either, since this does nothing to guarantee a happens-before relationship.


//4.  In the main thread, retain a reference to the CorrectorThread instance. Then invoke join on that instance before referring to message
//Encapsulate message in an object with synchronized methods. Never reference message except through those methods.
